### Template Literals (AKA Template Strings)

The string you want to print must be enclosed in ` (back-ticks)

```javascript
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // logs: Hello, Alice!
```

### VIM

i - insert text at cursor position
a - insert text AFTER cursor position

Y - copies a line of text to the buffer.
P - pastes it to the cursor's current position.
dd - will delete the whole line of text. This will also effectively "cut" a line of text as well. When you delete a line, it's placed in the buffer.
yy - copies a whole line of text.
